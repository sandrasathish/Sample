# [Boyscout](http://ianwalter.github.io/boyscout/)
*A collection of helper CSS classes so you'll always be prepared.*

## Installation

```
bower install boyscout --save
```

## Project Structure

All non-theme SASS modules are imported into a file called `base.scss`. There is
also a `theme` directory containing themes that build on `base`. You are free
to import the SASS files into your SASS project or use the compiled CSS files
(compiled using Gulp) directly.

## Gulp Tasks

`gulp` Compiles SASS source files into the `dist` directory
`gulp server` same as above but also serves them demo (index.html) and assets
 at http://localhost:8080/

I hope you find this useful!
